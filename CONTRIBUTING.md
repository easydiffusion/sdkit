# Setting up a developer environment
If you're on Windows or Linux, please install CUDA-compatible `torch` and `torchvision` (if you haven't already) using: `pip install torch torchvision --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116`

1. Create a fork of this repository using https://github.com/easydiffusion/sdkit/fork
2. Copy the link to your repository using the "Code" button in your repository. Important: Use YOUR fork for this.

3. Install an editable copy of your fork using: `pip install -e git+git@github.com:YOUR_FORK_NAME/sdkit.git#egg=sdkit` or `pip install -e git+https://github.com/YOUR_FORK_NAME/sdkit.git#egg=sdkit`. Replace `YOUR_FORK_NAME` with what your fork has.
4. This will checkout a working copy of sdkit, along with any required dependencies. Additional dependencies for local development and local testing can be installed by running:
   * `pip install -r requirements_dev.txt` for linting/formating 
   * `pip install -r requirements_test.txt` for unit tests
5. You can now edit the code and submit pull-requests for any changes you'd like to contribute.
