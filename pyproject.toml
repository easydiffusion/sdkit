It bundles Stable Diffusion along with commonly-used features (like SDXL, ControlNet, LoRA, Embeddings, GFPGAN, RealESRGAN, k-samplers, custom VAE etc). It also includes a model-downloader with a database of commonly used models, and advanced features like running in parallel on multiple GPUs, auto-scanning for malicious models etc."
